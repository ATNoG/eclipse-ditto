Ditto provides a search functionality as one of the services around its managed **Digital Twins**.

## Search index


## RQL

Ditto utilizes a subset of <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.rql}}">RQL</a> 
as language for specifying queries.

The [RQL project page](https://github.com/persvr/rql) says about it:

> [RQL] is a query language designed for use in URIs with object style data structures. [...]<br/>
RQL can be thought as basically a set of nestable named operators which each have a set of arguments. 
RQL is designed to have an extremely simple, but extensible grammar that can be written in a URL friendly query string.
