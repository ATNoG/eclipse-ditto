  Contains a comma-separated list of fields from the attributes to be
  included in the returned JSON.

  #### Selectable fields

  Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields as defined in the attributes by
  using a comma-separated list:
    * several properties paths can be passed as a comma-separated list of JSON pointers (RFC-6901)

      For example:
        * `?fields=model` would select only `model` attribute value (if present)
        * `?fields=model,make` would select `model` and `make` attribute values (if present)

  Supports selecting arbitrary sub-fields of objects by wrapping sub-fields
  inside parentheses `( )`:
    * a comma-separated list of sub-fields (a sub-field is a JSON pointer (RFC-6901) separated with `/`) to select
    * sub-selectors can be used to request only specific sub-fields by placing expressions in parentheses `( )` after a selected subfield

      For example:
       * `?fields=location(longitude,latitude)` would select the `longitude` and `latitude` value inside the `location` attribute

  #### Examples

  * `?fields=model,make,location(longitude,latitude)`

  * `?fields=listOfAddresses/postal(city,street))`
