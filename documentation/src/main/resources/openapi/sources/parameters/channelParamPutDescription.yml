  Defines to which channel to route the command: `twin` (digital twin) or `live` (the device).
  * If setting the channel parameter is omitted, the `twin` channel is set by default and the command is routed to the digital representation of a thing in Bosch IoT Things backend.
  * When using the `live` channel, the command/message is sent towards the device.

  The option `live` is not available when a new thing should be created, only for updating an
  existing thing.
