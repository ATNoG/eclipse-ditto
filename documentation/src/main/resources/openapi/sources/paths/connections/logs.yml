get:
  summary: Retrieve logs of a specific Connection
  description: |-
    Returns the logs of the connection identified by the `connectionId` path parameter.
    **Before** log entries are generated and returned, logging needs be enabled with the `command`
    `connectivity.commands:enableConnectionLogs`. When creating or opening an connection the logging is enabled per
    default. This allows to log possible errors on connection establishing.
